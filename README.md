**Project Name:-** JackpotHub

**Project Description:-**
JackpotHub – Revolutionizing the lottery experience
in Web3 era.
JackpotHub is a groundbreaking web3 lottery platform that redefines the
lottery experience, combining simplicity, security, and social engagement.
The platform aims to address the shortcomings of traditional lotteries and
bring transparency, trust, and collaboration to the forefront.

**The problem we are trying to solve:-**
1. Lack of Transparency:
Traditional lotteries lack transparency, making it challenging for participants
to verify the fairness of the draw. By leveraging web3 technology and raffle
NFTs, your app ensures transparency and immutability of lottery results,
providing an auditable and tamper-proof system.
2. Limited Trust:
Centralized lottery platforms often raise concerns about trust and security.
By utilizing blockchain and smart contracts, your app eliminates the need to
trust a centralized entity, as the entire lottery process is decentralized and
governed by the underlying blockchain network.
3. Minimal Social Interaction:
Traditional lotteries typically lack social engagement and collaboration
among participants. Your app aims to foster a vibrant community where
Players can connect, share strategies, and collaborate through social
features, enabling them to enhance their chances of winning and create a
more engaging lottery experience.
4. Monetization of Knowledge:
Our app allows participants to monetize their knowledge and strategies by
creating raffle NFTs that represent specific lottery strategies or syndicates.
This feature enables experienced players to share their expertise and
potentially earn rewards based on the success of their raffle NFTs.
